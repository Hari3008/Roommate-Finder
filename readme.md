# RoomateFinder
Finding housing and compatible roommates is a major challenge for international students moving to the USA. Our platform solves this by offering an all-in-one solution where students can list themselves to find roommates and explore rental properties tailored to their needs. At the same time, property listers can easily connect with this specific audience, ensuring reliable and secure leasing. With a user-centric design and intelligent matching algorithms, we aim to create a stress-free experience that helps international students find their home away from home.
